Hi {name},

(中文在下面)

Thank you very much for your purposal submission to COSCUP 2019. Unfortunately after reviewed over 100+ submission, your purposal “{talk_name}” was rejected by the program committee.

Also, there are still many ways to share your experience at COSCUP 2019! You may want to:

    Reply the mail, and tell us that you would like to be one of our backup sessions.
    Host a BoF gathering in the evening of the first day.

The information will be announced on blog.coscup.org before late July.

Hi {name},

非常感謝您投稿 COSCUP 2019。經議程委員針對所有稿件評估考量後，我們很遺憾無法將您的投稿「{talk_name}」放入正式議程。

雖然如此，但您仍有非常多機會在 COSCUP 2019 與大家分享您的見解。您可以：

    自告奮勇，來信告訴大會您願意被列為候補議程，在目前講者臨時無法出席等情況下協助遞補演講
    在第一天晚間的 BoF（同好會）時間召集同好分享

相關事宜，將於七月逐步於 blog.coscup.org 公佈，敬請密切關注。

Looking forward to see you in August!
您的支持對我們非常重要，期待在今年的 COSCUP 與您相見。

Sincerely,

COSCUP 2019 Team
